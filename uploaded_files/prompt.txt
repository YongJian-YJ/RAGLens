I am doing a final year project. It is about exploring the latest Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques that can improve the accuracy of RAG application. I am creating an application using streamlit. This applications aims to allow them to explore the techniques. A user can ask a query, then the rag application will generate the answer, as well as behind the scenes to show how the techniques actually work. You can see what I mean when I give you the code later. The main idea is there will be a home page to allow people to choose which technique they want to explore on. This main page will have an upload button for them to upload the documents. These documents will be used to construct a vectorstore. Of course, it is alright if user doesnt upload any documents as well, in this case, it will use the vectorstore constructed from the code. I have not done the main page, that's why I need your help. I have done the techniques pages. The techniques pages are flashRank.py and llmLingua.py. Let me know if you have any question.
